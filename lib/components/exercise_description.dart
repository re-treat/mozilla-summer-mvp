    """1. Acknowledge the distress: Without judging or criticizing yourself, take a moment to acknowledge and accept that you are, to a certain extent, disturbed by some kind of task that you think "I should do it today" but feel reluctant to start in it.\n' 
    2. Break it up: Let's break the task or the event that may sound intimidating into 3-5 smaller, specific and manageable steps. For example, when you plan to write an essay, you 1) brainstorm, 2) outline, 3) draft, 4) polish, 5) ask for advice, 6) final draft and submit.
    3. Find meaning and purpose: Reflect on what are some potential impact of the work you are going to do. Can you think of the meaning of this task for you or for somebody else, for now or for the future?
    4. A ritual for starting: While starting the task may sound unpleasant in anyway, why don't we create a little 5-10min ritual for ourselves to kick start the work and bring in some excitement. For someone this starting ritual can be a cup of coffee, a quick journal entry, a post-it notes or a youtube video. Come up with your starting ritual today:)
    5. Treat yourself for hitting the goal: Envision how you will treat yourself after finishing this task or one of the steps. Or, you can also imagine some positive feelings you might have upon successfully accomplishing what you want to achieve today.""",

        What does it mean to be kind to ourselves and to accept ourselves? Let's start with the three components of self-compassion: 
        1) Recognize our discomfort as an unavoidable part of every human being - Do you think at this moment, there are someone else who are experiencing similarly uncomfortableness as you are? If yes, take a moment to imagine 1 or 2 example(s) of another person's discomfort. *(a text entry box)*
        2) Face our painful thoughts directly, but not exaggerate them - Let's retell what's troubling ourselves right now by 2-3 sentences. How would you describe what is making you feel bad and why?  *(a text entry box)*
         3) Treat ourselves kindly when we perceive our inadequacy - At this moment, could you write down a short note that is caring, non-judgmental and accepting to yourself?  *(a text entry box)*

    'instructions':
      """
      Reframing is a simple cognitive-behavioral tool you can resort to when any negative thought comes to your mind. To reframe, we simply turn our attention from things disturbing us to things that you feel positive about at this moment. 
      For example, when we enter a strange space, our first thought might be "I hate the color of the wall". By reframing, we shift our mind away from the wall to other more pleasant stimuli in the room, like a beautiful carpet in the room. *(pure instruction)*
      This is a very simple 1-step exercise: Let's list out such things around you now that bring any kind of positivity and if you have time, try to add in some details about why they make you feel positively.

        This is a simple one-step exercise. Think back to a time when you felt a sense of awe regarding something you witnessed or experienced. Awe can be elicited in many ways, like when you witness the natural beauty or when you are impressed by a brilliant story. Sometimes negative events can also elicit awe, like natural disasters that make us feel overwhelmed and small. *(pure instruction)*
        Write down 2-4 sentences to describe one moment when you felt awe with as many details as possible. Not only include the thing that makes you feel this sense of awe, but also what exactly you were feeling at that moment. (Did you have a new understanding of the world or your life? Was there a sense of a small self or a broadened world? etc.) *(a text entry box)*

      1. Let's actually start thinking and talking about our financial issues and money first. What does money make you feel? What are the first things coming to your mind when thinking about money? *(a text entry box)*
      2. Face your fear and anxiety: What are the exact thing(s) about money or budget that makes you feel in such ways? Write down 1-2 sentence with specific language to summarize the source of your emotion. *(a text entry box)*
      3. Find what you haven't been clear about and what you can control: It is hard to assess our financial health if money in our mind is just a vague idea and we are afraid of actually knowing the numbers. Can you list out several financial items (e.g. your monthly income, monthly expenditure on food) that you haven't had a clear picture (i.e. the exact number) of? *(a text entry box)*
      4. Find what we can control and set up feasible goals: If we don't know where we are going to, we will not know how we can get there. Instead of a general statement like "I don't want to spend too much" or "I want financial stability", let's list out 3 to-do items that are related to what we can control and are action-oriented. An example can be "I want to print out my bank statement and review the deductions." *(a text entry box)*
      5. Take actions for step 3 and 4:) 70% people avoided talking about financial concerns, but today you have managed to start this conversation and plan for your next steps. Cheers! *(pure instruction)*

        1. Recognize Your Rights** *(pure instruction)*
          Behind a feeling of anxious, depressed or unfulfilled, sometimes deep down in our mind there is a sense of our rights being denied or neglected. First step is always recognition. **Can you recollect the recent circumstances that you felt in such ways, and detail in how your rights, wishes or ideas were not valued or acknowledged.** 
        2. Practice Your Assertive Script** *(a text entry box)*
           We all have a right to express our thoughts, feelings, and needs to others, as long as we do so in a respectful but assertive way. Assertiveness can be learned through scripting. For the following prompt, please use 1 sentence for each to practice your own assertive script:
           An objective and detailed description of the situation that troubles you without accusing or assuming others. What did the other(s) actually do? 
           An "I statement" like "I feel __ because ___" of your feeling that will help you take responsibility for yourself 
           Describe the changes you would like to make or see. That is, to make some reasonable requests and make them specific and clear. 
        3. Mental Broken Record:
           This is a technique you can use in real-life or in your mind, just by repeating the last part of the step 2, making reasonable and assertive requests, over and over in a calm and peaceful way, regardless of what responses you get. **You can either mentally repeat this sentence to yourself or type it again.** *(a text entry box)*

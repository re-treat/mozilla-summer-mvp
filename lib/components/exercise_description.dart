    'instructions':
    """1. Acknowledge the distress: Without judging or criticizing yourself, take a moment to acknowledge and accept that you are, to a certain extent, disturbed by some kind of task that you think "I should do it today" but feel reluctant to start in it.\n' 
    2. Break it up: Let's break the task or the event that may sound intimidating into 3-5 smaller, specific and manageable steps. For example, when you plan to write an essay, you 1) brainstorm, 2) outline, 3) draft, 4) polish, 5) ask for advice, 6) final draft and submit.
    3. Find meaning and purpose: Reflect on what are some potential impact of the work you are going to do. Can you think of the meaning of this task for you or for somebody else, for now or for the future?
    4. A ritual for starting: While starting the task may sound unpleasant in anyway, why don't we create a little 5-10min ritual for ourselves to kick start the work and bring in some excitement. For someone this starting ritual can be a cup of coffee, a quick journal entry, a post-it notes or a youtube video. Come up with your starting ritual today:)
    5. Treat yourself for hitting the goal: Envision how you will treat yourself after finishing this task or one of the steps. Or, you can also imagine some positive feelings you might have upon successfully accomplishing what you want to achieve today.""",
